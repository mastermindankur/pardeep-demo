        Delegate your complex outsourcing risk assessments to an autonomous AI agent. Simply provide the details of an outsourcing arrangement, and the agent will execute a comprehensive, multi-step workflow. It analyzes the use case, quantifies risks, determines the necessary level of review, and takes proactive compliance actionsâ€”all while providing a transparent audit trail for executive oversight. This is agentic AI in action: from analysis to action, completely autonomously.
