# RiskCheck AI: Autonomous Outsourcing Risk & Compliance

This is a Next.js application built in Firebase Studio that demonstrates the power of autonomous AI agents for complex business workflows. This application, "RiskCheck AI," is designed for outsourcing risk and compliance management.

## Key Features

*   **Autonomous Risk Assessment:** Delegate complex risk assessments to an AI agent that analyzes outsourcing arrangements, quantifies risks across multiple domains (operational, compliance, data, regulatory), and determines the required level of review.
*   **Agentic Actions:** The AI agent doesn't just analyzeâ€”it acts. For high-risk scenarios, it can autonomously create action items in a tracker and generate draft formal review documents, streamlining the compliance workflow.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** A second AI agent monitors the status of created action items, ensuring accountability and timely completion, and escalating when necessary.
*   **SLA Performance Monitoring:** Keep track of Service Level Agreements with outsourced providers, with AI-generated summaries to highlight breaches and prepare for review meetings.
*   **Centralized Hubs:** Manage all compliance-related documents and action items in dedicated, easy-to-use interfaces.
